    <h3>1. Continuous Integration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This sounds like a small gain, but how many times have you committed code that doesn't work on a colleagues machine or on the Test server?</li>
        <li>I know I certainly have many times ;) more about this later..</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Continuous Integration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR">MediatR</a> by Jimmy Bogard, Mediator pattern in general can help to fight problem with busy constructors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Other factors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pointless abbreviations - E.g. appId - could be application Id or ApplicantId in IRAMS</li>
        <li>DRY (Don't repeat Yourself) - think about whther it is worth abstracting this "private function" for instance into its own class which we can then Dependency Inject</li>
        <li>Idempotent means: the same operation can happen again and again with the same result</li>
    </ul>
