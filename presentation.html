            A tour around the MARS (Making Administrating Research Simpler) project, the use of Test Driven Development and how it is made easier by using Interfaces and DI (Dependency Injection).

                    <h3>The MARS Project</h3>
                    <h4>Making administrating Research Simpler</h4>
                    <p>Before the Project was paused, the UI side of the project was 70% complete, with only 4 bugs outstanding and with only one known regression.
                        All in less than 4 sprints...
                    </p>
                    <p>How was that possible?</p>

                    <h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
                    <p>When a commit is made a project "build" is kicked off</p>
                    <p>This means that the source code is delivered to a machine (could be a Cloud based Virtual Machine) and rebuilt from scratch</p>
                    <p>This sounds like a small gain, but how many times have you committed code that doesn't work on a colleagues machine or worse on the Test server - I know I certainly have many times ;) more about this later..</p>

                    <h3>The Dependency Injection Design Pattern Using Constructor-based Injection</h3>
                    <p>This means that the coupling between classes is explicitly made during the web project startup routine</p>
                    <p>This helps us to "prefer composition over inheritance" when we share dependent code. It also helps us to keep to the <i>principal of least knowledge</i></p>

                    <p>It also has another beneficial side effect - it makes it easier to unit test the business logic</p>
