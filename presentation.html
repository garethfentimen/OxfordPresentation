            A tour around the MARS (Making Administrating Research Simpler) project, the use of Test Driven Development and how it is made easier by using Interfaces and DI (Dependency Injection).

                    <h4>Making administrating Research Simpler</h4>
                    <p class="fragment slideright">Before the Project was paused, the UI side of the project was 70% complete, with only 4 bugs outstanding and with only one known regression.
                        All in less than 4 sprints...
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment" data-autoslide="10000" data-transition="zoom">How was that possible?</p>
                    <p class="fragment" data-autoslide="10000" data-transition="zoom">How was the project able to gain so much momentum in such a small space of time?</p>

                        <li class="fragment" data-autoslide="10000" data-transition="zoom">The source code is delivered to a "build machine" to be built and unit tested from scratch</li>
                        <li class="fragment" data-autoslide="10000" data-transition="zoom">This sounds like a small gain, but how many times have you committed code that doesn't work on a colleagues machine or on the Test server?</li>
                        <li class="fragment" data-autoslide="10000" data-transition="zoom">I know I certainly have many times ;) more about this later..</li>

                    <h3>The Dependency Injection Design Pattern Using Constructor-based Injection</h3>
                    <p>This means that the coupling between classes is explicitly made during the web project startup routine</p>
                    <p>This helps us to "prefer composition over inheritance" when we share dependent code. It also helps us to keep to the <i>principal of least knowledge</i></p>
